Title: Algebraic and Statistical Functions for Genetics
Author: Martin Schlather [aut, cre], Malena Erbe [aut, cre], Florian Skene [aut], Alexander Freudenberg [ctr]
Description: This is a collection of fast tools for application in quantitative genetics. For instance, the SNP matrix can be stored in a minimum of memory  and the calculation of the genomic relationship matrix is based on a rapid algorithm. It also contains the window scanning approach by Kabluchko and Spodarev (2009), <doi:10.1239/aap/1240319575> to detect anomalous genomic areas <doi:10.1186/s12864-018-5009-y>. Furthermore, the package is used in the Modular Breeding Program Simulator (MoBPS, <https://github.com/tpook92/MoBPS>, <https://www.mobps.de/>). The tools are based on SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD>) and OMP (Open Multi-Processing, <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP>).
